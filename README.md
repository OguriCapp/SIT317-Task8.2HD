# SIT317-Task8.2HD
For submitting SIT317 Task 8.2HD, including Deakin Nexus web by Hongming.

This High-Fidelity Prototype Minimum Viable Product is based on our team’s solution, Deakin Nexus. I chose to build the prototype as a web application. The main reason for choosing a web format is because it’s easy to access, and Deakin new students can open it on any device, which is greatly convenient for them to use. Also, as a new student, they need a clear and simple web project rather than complex webpage to better manage their academic progress.

As for the user testing, I plan to invite ten to twenty Deakin new students and also some of my classmates to try out my system. They will go through basic tasks like registering, checking the dashboard, editing tasks, schedules and attendance. I’ll eventually record their feedback using a table and group similar issues. And I will also try invalid inputs to test error handling. Then I would work to solve those problems and make this project better for use.
